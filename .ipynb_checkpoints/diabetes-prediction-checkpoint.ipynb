    "Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients is growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes. \n",

    "Individuals with diabetes face a risk of developing some secondary health issues such as heart diseases and nerve damage. Thus, early detection and treatment of diabetes can prevent complications and assist in reducing the risk of severe health problems. \n",

    "* Identifying the risk of diabetes at early stages, especially among pregnant women, can help to control the disease and prevent the second health problems.\n",
    "* As per the decision tree We can have Profile for women\n",
    "    - `Lower Risk Women` :Glucose level <=127 ,Age <=28.\n",
    "    - `Higher Risk Women`:Glucose level >100 ,Age >28 /BMI> 28.5\n",
    "    \n",
    "    But as per the patterns we see in misclassfied data.Our model is unable to find those case when Age or BMI plays major role than Glucose concentration.\n",
    "    So Glucose ,Age and BMI should be  given equal importance in identifying high risk patients.\n",
    " * Need to further explore if any other algorthims or more hypertuning parameters help in improving the accuracy of the model along with recall.\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Recommendation\n",
    "  Depending on the patients profile following recommendation to patients can prevent them from getting diabetes.\n",
    "* Middle aged to older women have a higher risk of diabetes. They should keep the glucose level in check and take proper precautions.\n",
    "* Overweight women have a higher risk of diabetes. They should keep the glucose level in check and exercise regularly. \n"
